  <h1>CTEC3905 Past Student Work</h1>

  <p>Here are some examples of the kind of work students have produced in previous years. I've put them into rough categories so you get an idea of how these websites were marked.</p>

  <p>Overall:</p>  
  <ul>
    <li>pass-rate was 96%</li>
    <li>average grade was 64%</li>
    <li>73/181 had firsts</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I will go through the marking criteria and show examples of each of the three categories ("not addressed", "partially addressed", and "fully addressed") for each of the points.</p>



  <h2>1. HTML and CSS Code Quality</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Valid HTML5 and CSS3 source code throughout</h3> 

  <p>Try and fix any errors and address warnings that are raised by the validator. Mostly this will catch serious syntax errors but it also points the way to good practice in general.</p>

  



  <h3>1.2. Consistent code nesting and indentation (2 spaces is industry-standard)</h3>













  <h3>1.3. Separate .css and .js files (e.g. no "style=" or "onclick" in HTML)</h3>


  <h3>1.4. Use of CSS3 features e.g. flexbox, animations, CSS grid</h3>


  <h3>1.5. Tidy file and folder organisation with lower-case names</h3>

  <p>This should be fairly self-explanatory. Keep file and folder names lower-case and don't include any spaces or underscores (use hyphens if necessary). We normally expect you to keep your images, CSS, and JS files in a separate folder each. Don't include any unused files you used during development. Clean the repository for your final commit. Your main homepage must be called "index.html". This is necessary for GitHub Pages to work and most web servers too.</p>

  ### 2\. JavaScript, APIs & JSON

  1. No JavaScript errors in the browser console
  2. Use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and/or interaction
  3. ES6 syntax: e.g.  "let" and "const" over "var", template literals, arrow functions
  4. Use of JavaScript to handle data (e.g. JSON from an external API)
  5. DRY code e.g. no repeated similar functions without parameters


  ### 3\. Responsiveness, Accessibility and Interaction

  1. Responsive at any size with mobile-first CSS breakpoints
  2. Well-ordered information architecture, ease of navigation at all sizes
  3. Web accessibility (e.g. HTML5 semantic elements, "alt" attributes, heading structure, etc.)
  4. Coherence of overall design - colour, content, styles, etc.
  5. CSS layout of HTML5 elements e.g. no tables


  ### 4\. GIT & GitHub

  1. Source code and live site on GitHub Pages
  2. Use of GIT branches for feature development
  3. Regular commits, not all last few days
  4. Brief, informative commit messages
  5. Basic readme.md file with references in markdown format (see NOTES)

  ---

  ### NOTES

  - use only native code e.g. no JQuery, Bootstrap, etc. although external assets are acceptable (images, FontAwesome and Google fonts)
  - in your GIT readme file, you should include consistently-formatted references to any external learning resources you have used
  - make sure your GitHub repository code is private and only visible to you (teaching and other admin staff are are already granted access)








  ## Fails




  ### Student 1

  - 4 commits all on day of deadline
  - images loose in folder
  - 2 empty css files
  - inline styles
  - onclick JS
  - inline JS that doesn't do anything
  - non-semantic elements
  - empty readme
  - no responsiveness


  ### Student 2

  - 22 commits all on day of deadline
  - weird progress files?
  - empty readme
  - very minimal JS
  - very basic css
  - no responsiveness
  - lots of typos in code
