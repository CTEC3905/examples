    <h2 id="design">Screenshots of overall design</h2>

    <p>Here are some examples of student work from the previous two years, with a rough idea of how they were marked overall.</p>
    <p>Please note that this <strong>only shows how the pages look</strong>, it <strong>doesn't show any animations or hover effects</strong>, and most of all it <strong>does not show the quality of the code</strong>. So some of the pages are marked higher or lower overall perhaps than you might expect due to underlying issues with the code. This includes for example <strong>API calls</strong> that bring in content dynamically from external sources which might not be clear from simply looking at the final design of the website.</p>

    <h2 id="quality">1. HTML and CSS Code Quality</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Valid HTML5 and CSS3 source code throughout</h3> 

    <p>Try and fix any errors and address warnings that are raised by the validator. Mostly this will catch serious syntax errors but it also points the way to good practice in general.</p>
    <p>For the HTML validation, errors must be avoided completely to get "partially" or "fully addressed". Warnings are less severe but you should still try to address them.</p>
    <p>Depending on the amount of CSS errors you have you might still get "partially addressed" if they are minor (or for example are to do with browser compatibility). Again warnings are less severe but you should still try to address them.</p>
    <p><strong>Validation is your friend! Use it often!</strong></p>
    <p>Often, programmer's text editors will highlight syntax errors as shown below (either by squiggly underline or by a change in colouring (e.g. white text instead of green). This can help you debug your code.</p>

    <p>If you are unsure about your indentation practice you can use a beautifier to indent your code for you (yes, we are essentially giving away marks here)! See links below:</p>
    <ul>

    <h3>1.3. Separate .css and .js files (e.g. no "style=" or "onclick" in HTML)</h3>

    <p>This is largely marked on amount of inline logic in the HTML. So for instance one occurance of "onclick" or a "width" declaration inside an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag would be considered "partially addressed". Several instances of this would be "not addressed" and of course no inline styles or scripts would be "fully addressed".</p>
    <p>The examples below are taken out of context of the whole repository so I can't really show the grading element for these fairly. Suffice to say inline styles and scripts like these should not happen ever.</p>

    <h3>1.4. Use of CSS3 features e.g. flexbox, animations, CSS grid</h3>

    <p>This largely depends on the number and quality of examples found in the code. There isn't a specific number of features you have to include, but it should cover at least one of the examples above well. For example you can use advanced flexbox to create multi-column layouts that adapt to screen-size, or you add a few different animations to your site, or you layout the page with grids that adapt to screen size too.</p>

    <section class="grid grades">
      <div>
        <p class="mid">not addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">only very basic CSS in general and no CSS3 features used at all, or very buggy or pointless (e.g. just slapping a <code>display: flex</code> on a random element with no effect</p>

        <p class="mid">partially addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">some attempts at using CSS3 features such as flexbox and animations but maybe slightly buggy or redundant, maybe contains an animation but includes lots of redundant vendor pre-fixes (e.g. "-webkit")</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mid">fully addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">good use of flexbox and or grids for layout, and/or good use of animations (e.g. rotating icons on hover, responsive grid layout, etc)</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <h3>1.5. Tidy file and folder organisation with lower-case names</h3>

    <p>This should be fairly self-explanatory. Keep file and folder names lower-case and don't include any spaces or underscores (use hyphens if necessary). We normally expect you to keep your images, CSS, and JS files in a separate folder each. Don't include any unused files you used during development. Clean the repository for your final commit. Your main homepage must be called "index.html". This is necessary for GitHub Pages to work and most web servers too.</p>

    <h2 id="js">2. JavaScript, APIs & JSON</h2>

    <p>Please note that you should only use native code e.g. no JQuery, Bootstrap, etc. External assets such as images, FontAwesome icons and Google fonts are acceptable.</p>

    <h3>2.1. No JavaScript errors in the browser console</h3>

    <p>This largely depends on the number of instances found in the console and the severity of the errors. Errors that break functionality are worse than warnings for example.</p>
    <p>It may be a good idea to include <code>console.log()</code> statements for debugging purposes. Remove them if things work out, or if not then leave them in to show your attempt of fixing them. Please also note that you should remove any <code>console.log()</code> statements before your site goes live as it is considered bad practice.</p>
    <p>Warnings can often be ignored as they're browser related, e.g. ad-block.</p>

    <section class="grid grades">
      <div>
        <p class="mid">not addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">this might include errors that could be easily fixed, not linking files properly (e.g. typos, wrong paths or wrong file names) and cases were there are no errors but no JS was used at all</p>

        <p class="mid">partially addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">this applies if we can see that you've tried to fix the errors either by using <code>console.log()</code> statements or comments in the code</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mid">fully addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">note that this only applies if a decent amount of "handwritten" JavaScript was used; if all you've done is copy and paste some Google maps script then we can't give you full marks for not having errors</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <h3>2.2. Use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and/or interaction</h3>

    <p>This largely depends on how JS was used. The point of this crtieria is for you to use JS to manipluate some content on the HTML page, for instance feedback of user input from a form (e.g. user enters name, name gets printed into a paragraph on the page). An alert box does not really count as "DOM manipulation" so would get "not addressed".</p>
    <p>This also includes "tabbed" layouts that dynamically show or hide content and hamburger mobile menus that are shown or hidden via JS.</p>
    <p>Please not that PHP scripts for contact forms are unmarked - we will ignore them completely. It's not going to affect your mark to have a non-functional contact form.</p>

    <section class="grid grades">
      <div>
        <p class="mid">not addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">Google maps with minimal customisation (e.g. coords) does not count towards this or very basic attempts of including JS such as a single <code>alert()</code> statement</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mid">partially addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">not fully functional perhaps due to some errors or very simple (e.g. basic innerHTML use)</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mid">fully addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">more than one instance of DOM manipulation or more advanced changes such as styling (not just content) (e.g. this document uses conditional colouring of figure captions, see <a href="scripts.js">scripts.js</a>)</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <h3>2.3. ES6 syntax: e.g.  "let" and "const" over "var", template literals, arrow functions</h3>

    <section class="grid grades">
      <div>
        <p class="mid">not addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">code full of <code>var</code> and standard string concatenation (e.g. <code>'hello ' + name + '!'</code> instead of <code>`hello ${name}!`</code>), maybe even some JQuery</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mid">partially addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">inconsistent use, maybe even some JQuery</p>

      <div>
        <p class="mid">fully addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">ES6 features used throughout and consistently, if no JS was used at all or very little you are not automatically getting full marks for one single instance of <code>let</code>, you have to show proficiency</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <h3>2.4. Use of JavaScript to handle data (e.g. JSON from an external API)</h3>

    <p>As mentioned briefly above in point 2.2 using a Google map in not technically handling JSON data via an API, so this might only get you "partially addressed" (depends on how much you customise the map for instance).</p>
    <p>There are many services out there with APIs related to images, news, weather, videos, Wikipedia, translations, maps, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>The use of the Google Fonts API or embedded YouTube videos, or Twitter "widgets" do not count towards this point.</strong></p>
    <p>Although Google maps is used in the examples below it is not compulsory.</p>

    <section class="grid grades">
      <div>
        <p class="mid">not addressed</p>
        <p class="bot">very basic Google map, possible as a inline script and with errors</p>
      </div>
      <div>

      </div>
    </section>

    <h3>2.5. DRY code e.g. no repeated similar functions without parameters</h3>

    <p>Code can generally be divided into two categories: DRY and WET code. DRY stands for <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong> and WET stands for <strong>Write Everything Twice</strong>. Industry best practice suggests you should use a DRY coding style instead of a WET one, as this is much more efficient and easier to debug and maintain.</p>

    <section class="grid samples">

        <figure>
          <img src="screenshots/dry0.png">
          <figcaption>WET</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="figdetails">you can clearly see the amount of duplication here that could have been prevented by writing a function with parameters</p>

        <p class="figdetails">again, this could have easily been turned into a simple function. create two variables that hold the lists of images and modals, then loop through the images one by one and change the style for the corresponding modal</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <p>This second example above could be rewritten easily as such: </p><code>
const imgs = document.querySelectorAll("[id^=img]");
const modals = document.querySelectorAll("[id^=modal]");
for(let i=1; i &lt;= imgs.length; i++){
  imgs[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
    modals[i].style.display = "block";
  })
}</code>
    <p>or even better (because <code>style.display</code> essentially adds an inline style to the HTML rather than a style rule to the CSS stylesheet) replace the "modals[i]" line with:</p> 
    <code>modals[i].classList.add("block");</code>
    <p>and add this rule to the stylesheet:</p>
    <code>.block { display: block }</code>
    <p>This easily reduces down the roughly 200 lines of code the student had previously (only a tiny proportion is shown in the screenshot above) to 7 or 8.</p>

    <h3>3.1. Responsive at any size with mobile-first CSS breakpoints</h3>

    <p>The starter code we have provided you with contains two breakpoints (<code>@media</code> rules in the CSS) in a mobile first style. This means that any styles for mobile go above (and outside of) the two media queries, any styles for tablet size devices should go into the first media query and styles for desktop monitors should go into the bottom media query.</p>
    <p>Most websites will not need any more breakpoints unless you have a very complex laypout. In fact you may not need the intermediary "tablet" size breakpoint even.</p>
    <p>There is no set number of breakpoints but we recommend either 1 or 2. For any specific extra breakpoints please explain in a code comment why they are needed.</p>

    <h3>4.2. Use of GIT branches for feature development</h3>

    <p>Branches are slightly more advanced feature of git. They should normally be used for feature development (e.g. a new JavaScript feature, or a re-design half way through).</p>
    <p>Here's some excellent resources on git branches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches">Atlassian Git Branch Tutorial</a></li>

    <h3>4.3. Regular commits, not all last few days</h3>

    <p>There isn't a set amount of commits you have to create in order to get "partially" or "fully addressed" here. It is possible to get full marks for this component if you have ten excellent commits, with very good commit messages spread out over a decent period to show progress.</p>
    <p>We might "checkout" individual commits to verify progress if there are concerns about the integrity of the code (i.e. suspected plagiarism).</p>
    <!-- <p>Plagiarism comments here?</p> -->
    <p>Here's an excellent resource on this topic in general:</p>

    <h3>4.4. Brief, informative commit messages</h3>

    <p>Look at the examples above to get an idea of what would be considered bad, good, and excellent commit messages.</p>

    <h3>4.5. Basic readme.md file with references in Markdown format</h3>

    <p>The readme ("readme.md" or "README.md") should contain some key information about your repository and website in valid Markdown text.</p>
    <p><strong>Mini Markdown Cheatsheet:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>
    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2, etc
    [link text](https://link.url)
    ![image alt text](folder/image.png)
    - bullet 1
    - bullet 2, etc
    1. numbered item 1
    2. numbered item 2, etc
    </code></pre>
    <p>The content of your readme is very individual and depends on your site, the issues you've faced, etc. But at the very least you should include references here to any external sources you've used (e.g. images, text content, embeded videos, API code, code examples from CodePen, W3Schools or other sources, etc.) Note that this does not have to be in Harvard referencing format but could simply be a url with a short description of what it was used for, for example:</p>
    <pre><code>
    # References
    - image gallery code adapted from [here](https://link.url)
    - Google maps code adapted from [here](https://link.url)
    </code></pre>
    <p>The beauty of GitHub is that if your readme file is named  and formatted correctly (and at the root of your repo, i.e. not in a sub-directory) then GitHub will automatically display it nicely on your repo website as shown below.</p>
